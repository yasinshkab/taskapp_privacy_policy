        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Task Control</strong> ("the App") collects, uses, and shares information when you use the App. By using the App you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Microphone audio:</strong> The App uses speech-to-text to transcribe voice input. Audio is processed on-device when possible and/or sent to the speech recognition service provided by the speech_to_text plugin. No audio is uploaded to our servers by default except when you explicitly use features that sync to Firebase.</li>
          <li><strong>Firebase account information:</strong> If you sign in, we store basic account identifiers and profile information required for authentication.</li>
          <li><strong>App data:</strong> Tasks, notes, and widget configuration are stored locally. If you enable cloud sync, task data is stored in your Firebase Realtime Database.</li>
          <li><strong>Device identifiers:</strong> Basic device information required for app functionality (OS version, device model) and crash/diagnostic data if you enable diagnostics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide core app functionality (task creation, sync, widgets, notifications).</li>
          <li>Synchronize user data across devices when you opt into Firebase sync.</li>
          <li>Send push notifications and scheduled reminders.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use Firebase for authentication and realtime database storage. We may use third-party plugins for notifications, scheduling, and speech recognition. These services are governed by their own privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>Ads and Analytics</h2>
        <p>This app does not serve ads. If analytics or advertising libraries are added in future releases, we will disclose them and update this policy.</p>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> required for voice input and speech-to-text features.</li>
          <li><strong>Exact alarms / background services:</strong> used to schedule reminders and update home screen widgets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may disclose data to comply with legal obligations or to protect rights and safety.</p>

        <h2>Data Safety and User Controls</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You can opt out of cloud sync by disabling account sign-in.</li>
          <li>To delete your data, disable cloud sync and remove account data within the app. If you have enabled cloud sync, you may need to remove cloud-stored data from the Firebase project (this is not automated by the app).</li>
        </ul>
